# Finalized Approach & Strategy (1-pager)

**Goal:** a CLI-first tool with an optional local web UI that:

1. **Resolves** full dependency graphs (direct + transitive) deterministically,
2. **Scans** against OSV (and friends) with batching, caching, and backoff,
3. **Reports** findings in **console** and **JSON**, and (bonus) an interactive React dashboard.

## Design principles

* **Lockfile-first** for correctness; fall back to materialized envs when needed.
* **Single source of truth**: the backend produces the canonical JSON report; all UIs render it.
* **Resilience**: dedupe queries, cache results by `(ecosystem, name, version)`, batch OSV calls, retry with jitter.
* **Clarity**: every vulnerable package includes severity, CVEs, summary, advisory link, and a suggested fixed version/range (when available). Each node has a **provenance path** (‚Äúwhy is this here?‚Äù).
* **Safety**: isolate temp installs, bind local servers to 127.0.0.1, sanitize inputs.

## Implementation plan (3 milestones)

**M1 (MVP):**

* Python CLI; parse Python `requirements.txt` (+ `poetry.lock`/`Pipfile.lock`) and Node `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock`.
* OSV `/v1/querybatch` with dedupe + backoff.
* Console + JSON outputs; summary stats.
* Minimal tests + sample fixtures.

**M2 (UX & depth):**

* FastAPI endpoints; serve a built React bundle.
* WebSocket/SSE progress; cache (SQLite).
* Ignore list; severity normalization; provenance paths.

**M3 (bonus polish):**

* Unmaintained flag (last release ‚â• X months).
* Static HTML export (CI artifact).
* SBOM export (CycloneDX) ‚Äî optional.

# DepScan ‚Äì Dependency Vulnerability Scanner (FDE Prompt Solution)

DepScan is a CLI + local web UI that:
- **Resolves** all direct **and transitive** dependencies from manifests/lockfiles
- **Scans** them against public vulnerability databases (OSV.dev)
- **Reports** vulnerabilities with suggested remediations
- **Exports** both **human-readable** and **JSON** reports

> **Resolve** = build the complete dependency graph (direct + transitive).  
> The tool **does not auto-fix**; it identifies known CVEs and proposes versions that remediate them.

---

## ‚úÖ Prompt Coverage (Crosswalk)

- **Correctness & completeness**: lockfile-first resolution; provenance paths; dedupe; cycle-safe graph walk.
- **Edge cases**: missing versions (materialize env), peer/optional deps (npm), markers/extras (Python).
- **Code quality & docs**: typed Pydantic models, clear modules, this README, CLI `--help`.
- **Supply chain awareness**: severity, CVE IDs, summaries, advisory links, fixed ranges; optional stale package flag.
- **API usage & structured output**: FastAPI (OpenAPI), robust OSV batching/backoff, JSON schema.

**Required deliverables**  
- CLI input (e.g. `./scanner.py requirements.txt`) ‚úî  
- Transitive resolution ‚úî  
- Uses external OSS packages (`fastapi`, `httpx`, `pipdeptree`, `uvicorn`, etc.) ‚úî  
- Outputs: console + JSON ‚úî

**Bonus**  
- Multi-ecosystem (JS + Python) ‚úî  
- Ignore list ‚úî  
- Unmaintained flag ‚úî  
- Simple web UI (React) ‚úî

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Ecosystems**: Python (`requirements.txt`, `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`), JavaScript (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`)
- **Transitive resolution** with provenance paths (‚Äúwhy is this here?‚Äù)
- **OSV batch scanning** with caching + backoff on rate limits
- **Dual outputs**: interactive React report + JSON export (+ optional static HTML)
- **Ignore list** support (suppress specific advisories or packages)
- **Unmaintained flag** (optional: no releases in ‚â• X months)

## üß≠ User Journeys

### 1) Zero-setup Local Web App (recommended)
- Build React once; serve static files from FastAPI.
- One command starts everything and opens the browser.

```mermaid

    actor Developer
    participant CLI as Python CLI
    participant API as FastAPI Backend
    participant Resolver as Resolver
    participant OSV as OSV.dev (and friends)
    participant UI as React (served statically)

    UI->>API: POST /scan (multipart)
    API-->>UI: 202 Accepted {job_id}
    UI->>API: WebSocket /ws/:job_id (subscribe)
    API->>Resolver: Start background scan
    Resolver->>Resolver: Parse manifests ‚Üí full graph with paths
    Resolver->>Cache: Check (ecosystem,name,version)
    par Cache miss
        Resolver->>OSV: querybatch (batch)
        OSV-->>Resolver: vulns
        Resolver->>Cache: store

        Cache-->>Resolver: vulns
    end
    Resolver->>API: Emit partial chunks

```

**Separation of concerns**

* **resolver** ‚Üí pure-ish graph with `path` provenance
* **scanner** ‚Üí vulnerability lookups (batch, cache, retry)
* **reporter** ‚Üí merge, severity normalize, stats
* **ui** ‚Üí render report; no business logic

---

## üì¶ Installation

Prereqs: Python 3.10+, Node 18+

```bash
# Backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Frontend (build once)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

> The React build outputs to `frontend/dist/`. FastAPI serves it from `/`.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local web app (single command)

```bash
dep-scan ./my-repo --open
# opens http://127.0.0.1:PORT with the dashboard
```

### CLI only (console + JSON)

```bash
dep-scan ./my-repo --json out/report.json
```

### Static artifacts (CI)

```bash
dep-scan ./my-repo --report out/report.html --json out/report.json
```

---

## üîå API (FastAPI)

* `POST /scan` ‚Äì multipart (files) or JSON with `{ "repo": "/path", "options": {...} }` ‚Üí returns `{ job_id }`
* `GET /status/{job_id}` ‚Äì progress + partial results (polling)
* `GET /report/{job_id}` ‚Äì final JSON report
* `GET /export/{job_id}.csv|json` ‚Äì downloadable artifacts
* `WS /ws/{job_id}` or `GET /stream/{job_id}` (SSE) ‚Äì live progress/chunks

---

## üßæ Data Contracts (Pydantic)

```python
from typing import Optional, Literal, List
from pydantic import BaseModel

Ecosystem = Literal["npm","PyPI"]

class Dep(BaseModel):
    name: str
    version: str
    ecosystem: Ecosystem
    path: List[str]  # provenance: parent chain -> ... -> this dep

class Vuln(BaseModel):
    package: str
    version: str
    ecosystem: Ecosystem
    severity: Optional[str]      # normalized (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
    cve_ids: List[str]

    published: Optional[str]     # ISO date
    modified: Optional[str]      # ISO date

class Report(BaseModel):
    job_id: str
    total_dependencies: int
    vulnerable_count: int
    vulnerable_packages: List[Vuln]
    dependencies: List[Dep]
    suppressed_count: int
    meta: dict   # generated_at, durations, warnings, rate_limit_info
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

* **Prefer lockfiles** for determinism

    * Node: parse `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock` or use `npm ls --all --json`
    * Python: parse `poetry.lock` / `Pipfile.lock`; fallback: temp venv + `pipdeptree --json-tree`
* **Batch OSV queries** with `/v1/querybatch`; dedupe by `(ecosystem,name,version)`
* **Cache** OSV results in SQLite to minimize repeat calls
* **Backoff** with jitter on 429/5xx; split large batches
* **Ignore list**: YAML mapping

  ```yaml
  # .dep-scan-ignore.yml
  CVE-2020-8203: "Known low-impact in our context"
  lodash@4.17.20:
    - "Temporary suppression until 2025-09-01"
  ```

  CLI flags: `--ignore .dep-scan-ignore.yml` and UI toggle ‚ÄúShow suppressed‚Äù
* **Unmaintained flag** (optional): `--stale-months 12` ‚Üí annotate deps with last release date
* **Security**:

    * Bind to `127.0.0.1`
    * Size-limit uploads; sanitize filenames; temp dirs
    * If materializing envs, isolate (venv/container); never execute repo scripts

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Dev Mode

```bash
# Terminal A ‚Äì API with reload
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Terminal B ‚Äì React dev server (HMR)
npm run dev   # defaults to :5173
```

Set `VITE_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8000` in the frontend env.

---

## üß™ Testing

* **Unit tests**: graph building (fixtures: tiny py/js projects), OSV response parsing, fix range extraction, ignore rules, severity normalization, stats.
* **Integration**: end-to-end against a small sample repo; snapshot JSON report.
* **CLI**: golden-file test for console output.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

* Mixed scans (JS + Python in one run) with ecosystem auto-detect
* SBOM export (CycloneDX)
* Proposed upgrades diff output
* Policy rules (min severity thresholds, blocked packages)
* Additional sources (GHSA, NVD mirror) as optional enrichers
