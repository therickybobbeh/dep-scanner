## Reporting a Vulnerability

### 🔒 For Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in DepScan, please report it **privately** to help us address it before public disclosure.

**How to Report:**
1. **Email**: Send details to your repository security team
2. **GitHub**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Do NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities

**What to Include:**
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fixes (if any)
- Your contact information

### 📧 Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Within 30 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed (coordinated disclosure)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### CLI Usage
- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version from TestPyPI
- **Verify Installation**: Only install from trusted sources
- **File Permissions**: Ensure scan results have appropriate permissions
- **Network Security**: CLI works offline after initial OSV database sync

#### Web Interface Deployment
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Access Control**: Implement authentication for sensitive environments
- **Network Security**: Deploy behind firewalls and security groups
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated using Pydantic models
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit security linting in CI/CD
- **Container Security**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities

#### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse
- **CORS Policy**: Restrictive cross-origin policies
- **Input Sanitization**: All file uploads and inputs sanitized
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

✅ **Local Processing**: No data sent to external services (except OSV API)
✅ **No API Keys**: No credentials required for basic functionality
✅ **Open Source**: Full code transparency for auditing
✅ **Dependency Validation**: Scans its own dependencies for vulnerabilities
✅ **Secure Defaults**: Conservative security settings by default

### Data Privacy

- **No Tracking**: No analytics or user tracking
- **Local Storage**: All scan results stored locally
- **Temporary Files**: Cleaned up automatically
- **No Data Collection**: No personal or project data collected

## Known Security Considerations

### Low Risk
- **Dependency Resolution**: Queries public package registries (PyPI, npm)
- **Vulnerability Database**: Queries OSV.dev API for vulnerability data
- **File Processing**: Parses local dependency files (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)

### Mitigation
- All external API calls use HTTPS
- No personal/sensitive data transmitted
- Local file processing only
- Input validation on all parsed files

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Security issues reported privately first
2. **Coordinated Timeline**: Agreed disclosure timeline with reporter
3. **Credit**: Public credit given to reporters (if desired)
4. **Transparency**: Public disclosure after fixes are available

### Public Disclosure

After a security issue is fixed:
- Release notes will include security fix information
- CVE numbers assigned for significant vulnerabilities
- Security advisories published on GitHub
- Users notified through appropriate channels

## Security Auditing

### Regular Reviews
- **Dependency Audits**: Monthly security scanning of dependencies
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes reviewed for security implications
- **Automated Testing**: Security tests in CI/CD pipeline
- **Third-party Audits**: Periodic external security assessments

### Tools Used
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning  
- **Snyk**: Container and dependency scanning
- **GitHub Security**: Automated vulnerability alerts

## Contact Information

### Security Team
- **Primary Contact**: Repository maintainers
- **Response Time**: 48 hours for initial response
- **Encryption**: PGP keys available on request

### Emergency Contact
For critical security issues requiring immediate attention:
- **Priority**: Critical vulnerabilities affecting production systems
- **Response**: Best effort within 24 hours
- **Escalation**: Direct contact with project maintainers
